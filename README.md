**Abstract.** We construct gradient structures for free boundary problems with nonlinear elasticity and study the impact of moving contact lines. In this context, we numerically analyze how phase-field models converge to certain sharp-interface limits when the interface thickness tends to zero $\varepsilon\to 0$. In particular, we study the scaling of the Cahn-Hilliard mobility $m(\varepsilon)=m_0\varepsilon^\alpha$ for $0\le \alpha \le \infty$. In the presence of interfaces, it is known that the intended sharp-interface limit is only valid for $\underline{\alpha}<\alpha<\overline{\alpha}$.  However, in the presence of moving contact lines we show that $\alpha$ near $\underline{\alpha}$ produces significant errors.
