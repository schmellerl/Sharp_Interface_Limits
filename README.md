### Sharp-interface limits of Cahn-Hilliard models and mechanics with moving contact lines ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.0496](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04968))

We numerically analyze how phase-field models converge to certain sharp-interface limits when the interface thickness tends to zero. Here we provide the numerical Codes for the diffuse- and the sharp-interface models.
