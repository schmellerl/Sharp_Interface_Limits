**Abstract.** We construct gradient structures for free boundary problems with nonlinear elasticity and study the impact of moving contact lines. In this context, we numerically analyze how phase-field models converge to certain sharp-interface limits when the interface thickness tends to zero $\varepsilon\to 0$. In particular, we study the scaling of the Cahn-Hilliard mobility $m(\varepsilon)=m_0\varepsilon^\alpha$ for $0\le \alpha \le \infty$. In the presence of interfaces, it is known that the intended sharp-interface limit is only valid for $\underline{\alpha}<\alpha<\overline{\alpha}$.  However, in the presence of moving contact lines we show that $\alpha$ near $\underline{\alpha}$ produces significant errors.

In the image below we show the central setup studied in this paper: A droplet relaxes from an initial state at t=0 to a relaxed state at t=1.15. The droplet (blue) is liquid with and the substrate (gray) is a neo-Hookean solid. During the evolution the sum of elastic and surface/interfacial energy decreases. The solution shown uses sharp interfaces.
